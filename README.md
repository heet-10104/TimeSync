# TimeSync
VIT university has a unique system `FFCS` that allows the students to make their own time table providing the flexibility.

However, since the system is based on merit and there are different slots for different branches it is not always possible to keep track of all your friends time table.

We have made this application to help keep track of all your friends time tables.

## Usage
To run the project first install [Go](http://golang.org) and clone this repository on your computer.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Heet-10104/timesync
cd timesync
```
and then run
```bash
go run .
```
